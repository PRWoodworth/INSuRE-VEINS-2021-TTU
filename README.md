First and foremost: I apologize for the empty folders. 
That is to indicate the correct filepath for where the given files are supposed to be placed, assuming you are using the InstantVeins 5.1 VM. 
I can not guarantee proper file locations or functions on a different version of the VM or anything of the sort.
